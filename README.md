## Introduction

This directory contains supplementary code for our Mendelian randomization analysis to dissect causal effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids on COVID-19 using the TwoSampleMR R package by Yitang Sun and Kaixiong Ye.

Any of the most recent COVID-19 GWAS can be used in the code to apply MR analyses.
